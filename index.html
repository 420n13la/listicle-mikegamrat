        <h1 class="number">2. bbno$</h1>
        <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjar_TtxnV4">Nursery by bbno$</a>
        <p class="para">bbno$ is a Canadian rapper born in Vancouver in 1995. His real name is Alexander Gumuchian.
           He often colaborateswith another underated rapper named yung gravy and they make very good music.  Recently, he released
      a song called lalala which blew up because of an app known as tik tok.  Although he is starting to gain
    trction in the music industry, I still believe that he is underrated and will soon be at the top.</p>
